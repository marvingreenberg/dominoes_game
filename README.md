# dominoes_game

Just a work area to store some code and ideas for a working python dominoes game
Note that https://dominoes.readthedocs.io/en/latest has a much more complete dominoes implementation.
This project will seek to add support for some graphics and maybe animations, and perhaps some
turn-based network play.
